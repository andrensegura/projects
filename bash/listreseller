# Notes:
# 1. In code, please keep under 80 col if at all possible. There are exceptions
#   i.e. URLs, here-docs, etc, but in general just keep it under 80 if you can.
# 2. Please keep definitions of global variables in the variable section, and
# keep all the 'runtime' stuff at the bottom. By 'runtime' I mean stuff that's
# not in a function. This mainly applies to bash scripts.
# 3. In bash, keep all the important runtime logic done in a _main function.
# 4. Keep multi-line variables in here-docs, and use the bash bultin 'read' for
# declaring the here-docs. Don't waste a call to cat(1) .
