I'm new to Rust, so I figure that the best way
to learn is by doing! Thanks to

I have a nice PDF of challenges to work through. For anyone that isn't a newbie,
these challenges are super easy. That's what I want. Rust is scary.
Hopefully I stick with this long enough to make it to the medium challenges, no problem.
