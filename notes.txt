interesting thing cPanel does.
there is /usr/bin/cc which is not part of the "compiler" group, but it's
just a symlink to /usr/bin/gcc,  which is part of said group.
had to `chown :compiler /usr/bin/cc` in order to use rusts compiler, rustc.

-----------------------
Good to remember:
"We expected an integer, but we got (). () is pronounced unit, and is a special
type in Rust's type system. In Rust, () is not a valid value for a variable of
type i32. It's only a valid value for variables of the type (), which aren't
very useful. Remember how we said statements don't return a value? Well,
that's the purpose of unit in this case. The semicolon turns any expression
into a statement by throwing away its value and returning unit instead."

-----------------------
panic! is a macro, similar to println!() that we've already seen. Unlike
println!(), panic!() causes the current thread of execution to crash with the
given message.

Because this function will cause a crash, it will never return, and so it has
the type '!', which is read "diverges." A diverging function can be used as
any type:

let x: i32 = diverges();
let x: String = diverges();

ANYTHING BEFORE THIS LINE IS RUST BETA
